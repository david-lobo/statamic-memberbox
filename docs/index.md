# Introduction

This Statamic addon adds a few member related extras on top of Statamic’s existing user features. You *don’t* need this addon to build a members area or member restricted content, but these extras might come in useful.

:::important
This addon requires Statamic’s [multi-user features](https://statamic.dev/users), which are Pro only. Therefore this addon will only work with the Pro edition of Statamic.
